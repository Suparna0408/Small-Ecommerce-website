            <h2>Sonakshi Sinha's Weight Loss Journey</h2>
            <p>
                While there are a few celebrities, who motivated us with their weight-loss transformation, but the most
                inspiring among them is birthday girl Sonakshi Sinha. She, who used to weight around 90 kilos at the
                beginning of her inspirational transformation, shed almost 30 kg before making her debut in Bollywood.
                If you are too inspired by her fat-to-fit transformation and want to shed kilos, you are in the right
                place. Today, we tell you the super secrets behind Sinhaâ€™s fit body, from the diet she followed to the
                vigorous workout she did to go from a massive 90 kilos to a fitter 60-kilo actress! Scroll on to find
                out.

                Sonakshi trains with celebrity trainer Namrata Purohit for pilates. This low impact flexibility workout
                is super effective when it comes to toning abdominal muscles. With endurance movements that are much
                slower than normal workouts, Pilates help you build muscular strength, improve your posture and
                drastically strengthen your core.

                You probably already know that cardiovascular exercise is one of the best ways to lose weight. Sonakshi
                swears by crunches, Stairmaster, rowing machines, and climbers workout in order to stay fit. Apart from
                all these exercises, she also includes some cycling in her workout which helps reduce body fat and toned
                thighs. But that's not it. Cardio also makes your body flexible, relaxes your mind, and gives relief
                from depression. It also reduce your risk of heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure,
                diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

                Not only cardio and pilates, Sinha also lifts a lot of weights to stay fit. Weight training helps tone
                the muscles and strengthens them. It improves functional performance, as well as bone density,
                structure, and strength in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. It also boosts energy levels and
                improves your mood.
